# ECE143 Project


The pre-trained weights for the Ensemble Model and the ExtraTreeClassifier can be downloaded from this Google Drive folder: [Model Weights](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zXDAAJkvUK8wZCzr4DZojyVU2zw_6_uI?usp=sharing). These weights are required for replicating the classification results in our project.
